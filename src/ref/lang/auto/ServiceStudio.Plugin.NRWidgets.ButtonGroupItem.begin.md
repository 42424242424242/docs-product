The ButtonGroupItem is an individual button that represents an option within a [Button Group widget](../../../develop/ui/patterns/web/controls/buttongroup.md). The Button Group Item must be used with a Button Group widget (unlike the Button widget, which is an interface element on its own).

When you drag the Button Group widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen, by default, the widget contains 3 Button Group Items. You can add or delete as many Button Group Items as required and customize their properties as you wish.
