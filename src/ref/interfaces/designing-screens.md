This page contains an overview of widgets. It also links to pages that provide additional  information about specific widgets available for designing Screens.

## Widgets overview
Widgets in OutSystems are building blocks that help you to design and organize your appâ€™s user interface. Widgets are visual elements designed to take user input or to display data on a Screen. For example, widgets that take user input include Form and Input widgets. When you use widgets that take user input, you bind them to a variable that holds the user input data. Widgets that display data, wuch as Table widgets, require that you define a data source.

Widgets appear in the Service Studio toolbox, on the left side of the main screen. Available widgets in the toolbox vary by app type. You can drag widgets to UI Screens, and then set their properties.  

Widgets help you to quickly create the following Screen elements, among many others:

* Display one or more record or line of information with **Display widgets**, such as Table widgets
* Take input from users with **Data Input widgets**, such as Text Area and Input
* Use **Button** or **Link Widgets** to navigate between Screens or to trigger other actions
* Display one of two areas on a Screen based on a Boolean condition with an **If Widget**
* Provide yes or no input options or one selection out of many options with 
**Choice Input widgets**, such as Checkbox, Radio Button, or Combo Box Widgets 
* Group widgets with **Container Widgets** and apply styles to them 
* Create reusable UI elements for use within an app or across apps with the **Block** or **Web Block Widget**
