# Restrict Access to an Internal Network


You can tighten the security of your applications, or part of them, by only allowing the access to end users who have authenticated themselves in an IP belonging to an internal network.

You can restrict internal network access to the following elements:

* UI Flows of a Web application (restricts the access of the Web Screens within the Flow)
* Exposed REST APIs

To restrict these elements to internal network access, set its **Internal Access Only** property to `Yes`.
