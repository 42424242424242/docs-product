# Testing your application

## draft page for an overview/landing page for the new testing section

As your applications grow in scale and complexity, validating them can take longer, especially if validation is manual. If not addressed, more time for testing can slow the pace of delivery. Automated testing is one way software teams can shorten delivery timelines and ensure application code works as designed.

OutSystems provides tools, guidance, and best practices for implementing automated testing in your environment. 

### Test categories

When mapped to general test categories, component tests in OutSystems may include the following test types:

* **Unit Tests**, which focus on individual units of code or components and are owned and executed by developers
* **Integration Tests**, which focus on testing whether two or more components work together; these touch a broader application scope than unit testing
* **API Tests**, which verify the contract and behavior of your application's existing API endpoints
* **Load Tests**, which aim to determine if the system can handle a specific load
* **UI Tests**, which validate that the application's user interfaces allow users to fulfill their tasks


### Component testing with BDDFramework tools
Component testing is the process of testing public actions. BDDFramework is the recommended tool for planning and executing component testing. The following resources provide more information.

* [Component testing with BDDFramework tools](/testing-bdd-framework.md) -- Introduction to BDDFramework tools that includes installation and getting started steps
* [Your Complete Guide to BDD Testing in Outsystems](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/bdd-testing/) -- Comprehensive blog post describing how to use the BDDFramework for server-side testing
