# Section

You can use the Section UI Pattern to organize on-screen content into different sections. This pattern can also be used with the Section Index UI Pattern to create anchors for each section.

**How to use the Section UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Section`.
  
    The Section widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/section-1-ss.png>) 

    If the UI widget does not display, it may be because you used a ready-made app, which deletes unused widgets from the module. To make additional widgets available in your app:

    a. Go to **Module > Manage dependencies**.

    b. Search for and select the relevant Producer, for example OutSystemsUI. Ensure Show All is selected. 

    c. On the Public elements for the selected Producer displayed on the right, ensure Show All is selected.
    
    d. Search for and select the element you want to add, and click **Apply**. 
    
    e. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. To From the Toolbox, drag the Section widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/section-2-ss.png?width=800>)

    By default, the Section widget contains Title, Actions, and Content placeholders.

1. Add your content to the placeholders. In this example, we add a title to the Title placeholder, text to the Content placeholder, and a button to the Actions placeholder.

    ![](<images/section-3-ss.png?width=800>)

1. Add the desired action to the content you have added to the Actions placeholder. In this example, the button we added redirects the user to a new page.

    ![](<images/section-6-ss.png?width=800>)

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
