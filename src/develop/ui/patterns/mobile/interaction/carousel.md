# Carousel

You can use the Carousel UI Pattern to display multiple items in a horizontal slide.  The Carousel Pattern optimizes screen space by displaying only a few images from a larger collection which you can view using the navigation controls.

**Note:** The Carousel Pattern is based on the Splide.js library (v3). For more information about the Carouselâ€™s behaviors and extensibility methods, see [Splide.js](https://splidejs.com/).  

## How to use the Carousel UI Pattern

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Carousel`.
  
     The Carousel widget is displayed.

    If the UI widget doesn't display, it's because the dependency isn't added. For example, if you are using a ready-made app, it deletes unused widgets from the module. Make the widget available in your app:

    1. In the Toolbox, click **Search in other modules**.

    1. In **Search in other Modules**, select the widget you want to add from the **OutSystemsUI module**, and click **Add Dependency**.

    1. In the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Carousel widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    By default, the Carousel pattern contains a **CarouselItems** placeholder with a **List** widget and **Image** widget. If you want a Carousel with static images, you can remove the **List** widget and add your images inside the **CarouselItems** placeholder.

1. Add your content to the **Carousel Items** placeholder. 

    In this example, the List is deleted and 3 Image widgets are added.

1. Select the **Image** widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Image** drop-down, select or import the image you want in the Carousel. 

    **Note:** In this example, the image Type is set to Local image. You can also add External and Binary Data images. In this example, the image property Type is set to **Local** image. You can also add [External and Binary Data](../../../image/display-image.md) images.

1. Repeat step 4 for each of the images in the Carousel. 

1. You can configure the Carousel by selecting the pattern, and on the **Properties** tab, set the relevant (optional) properties, for example, **Navigation** or **ItemsPerSlide**.For more configurations, expand the **OptionalConfigs** property.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
