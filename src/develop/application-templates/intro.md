# Application Templates

OutSystems apps consists of Modules that start from an Application Template. These make development efficient because the apps based on Application Templates contain many predefined elements. For example, they already have login and error screens, a theme, layout blocks, or any other elements...

There are built-in, custom and forge application templates.

### Built-in Application Templates

Reactive Web App, Phone App, Tablet App and Traditional Web are Built-in Application Templates created and maintained by OutSystems. They reference the OutSystems UI Framework and enable you to use its theme, patterns, screen templates and other components.

### Custom Application Templates

These are Application Templates you create, based on the UI framework of the source Application Template. The document [Create a Custom Application Template](<../ui/reuse/create-a-custom-application-template.md>) explains how to create these templates.

### Forge Application Templates

These are Application Templates provided by the OutSystems Community and shared at [Forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/#category=templates).
