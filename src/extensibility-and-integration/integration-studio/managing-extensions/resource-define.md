# Define Resources

Once you have created your extension, simply define the resources that your extension requires. The resources of your extension are displayed in the [Resources tree](<../../../ref/integration-studio/resources-tree.md>).

All these resources are packed in the XIF (Extension and Integration Framework) file when the extension is saved.

The resources can be added implicitly by Integration Studio; or you can add any file as a resource of your extension. For example, icons associated with the extension actions or help files that must be available for Service Studio developers.

When creating a new extension or updating the extension source code, Integration Studio implicitly adds the source files as resources, which are generated based on the template files. For more information, see [Extension Source Files](<../getting-started/extension-source-files.md>).  

To add a resource do the following:

1. Copy the file you want to add to the resources directory. Once the file is copied, the status of the resource, in the [Resources tree](<../../../ref/integration-studio/resources-tree.md>), is ![](images/resource-faded.gif) Excluded.

    ![](images/tip.gif) To determine the resources directory, right-click in the Resources icon and select the Open option.

1. Right-click on this file and select the ![](images/resource-include.gif) Include in Extension option. Once the file is added as resource, the status is ![](images/resource-add.gif) Included.

1. Specify the following properties:

    * **Name**: name of the resource.
    * **Last Modified**: Read-only property that indicates the date and time when the resource was last modified since the last save.
    * **Deploy Action**: indicates where, in the Platform Server, the resource is stored when the module that added the extension is published.
    * **Description**: description of the resource.

![](images/tip.gif) The [Resource editor](<../../../ref/integration-studio/editor/resource.md>) allows you to later change the resource properties.

When including a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file as a resource of your extension, beware of a possible name clash between the resource filename and the name of an application module.

For example, you may get runtime issues if you include a resource named `MyResource.dll` in your extension while also having an application module named `MyResource` in the app that uses the extension. Since OutSystems generates a `MyResource.dll` file for this module, the extension resource file might get overwritten, depending on the publishing method you use (1-Click Publish operation or solution publish).

To prevent this, you should rename the application module so that there's no clash between the extension resource filename and the module name.
