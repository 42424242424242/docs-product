### Bug fixes

Resolved issues in ML Builder.

* Fixed an issue that prevented training more than two models in parallel, in the same cluster.
* Fixed the cluster name so it can accept more than 16 characters.
* Fixed the decimal score representation so it doesn't show as a set of characters but the decimal value.

## Release Dec 7 2020

## What's new

New in ML Builder.
